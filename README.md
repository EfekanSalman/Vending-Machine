# Vending-Machine

This application is a vending machine simulation developed using Java Swing. Users can select products, view the total price, and make a payment. The application provides a simple and user-friendly interface that displays images of products, and by clicking on the products, the total price gets updated. Users can enter the payment amount, and the application calculates any change or displays an "insufficient funds" message if the amount is not enough.

Total Calculation: The total amount is automatically updated as products are selected.
Payment Processing: Users can enter an amount, and the application will handle the transaction, providing the correct change if applicable.
Clear Button: A button to clear the current selection and reset the total amount.
